# Fix WP Engine Multisite Admin Bar

This WordPress plugin fixes a bug in the WP Engine Quick Links admin bar. In multisite installations, all users except Super Admins reach an error message when clicking the Empty Caches menu item. This plugin prevents that error and empties the WP Engine Varnish and memcached caches no matter who clicks Empty Caches.
